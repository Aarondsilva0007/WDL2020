        <p  align="center">
            Mangalore, officially known as Mangaluru, is the major port city of the Indian state of Karnataka.
        It is located between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats mountain range about 352 km (219 mi) west of Bangalore, 
        the state capital. Mangalore is the state's only city to have all four modes of transportâ€”air, road, rail and sea. 
        The population of the urban agglomeration was 619,664 according to the 2011 national census of India.
        The city developed as a port in the Arabian Sea during ancient times; it has since developed into a major port of
        India that handles 75 per cent of India's coffee and cashew exports, and is the country's seventh largest container
        port. Mangalore has been ruled by several major powers, including the Kadambas, Alupas, Vijayanagar Empire, Keladi 
        Nayaks and the Portuguese. The city was a source of contention between the British and the Kingdom of Mysore rulers
        Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, and was eventually annexed by the British in 1799. Mangalore remained part of the Madras 
        Presidency until India's independence in 1947 and was unified with Mysore State (now called Karnataka) in 1956.
